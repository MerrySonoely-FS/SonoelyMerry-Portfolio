⚙️ Overview – Week 2 - 05-16-25
This past week, I focused on refining the front-end components of my portfolio site, particularly the Projects section. I implemented responsive card layouts using Flexbox, enhanced the UI with hover effects, and integrated image assets and GitHub links. I also cleaned up the color palette using CSS variables to ensure consistency and maintainability across the site.

🌵 Challenges – What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
One challenge I faced was getting the hover effects to feel smooth and visually appealing without disrupting the layout, especially on mobile. At first, my transitions were either too subtle or too abrupt. To address this, I experimented with different CSS transitions and timing functions. I also struggled briefly with aligning elements inside the project cards but resolved it by revisiting my Flexbox setup and setting consistent padding/margins.

🏆 Accomplishments – What is something I "leveled up" on this week
This week, I leveled up my CSS styling and UI design skills, especially in writing scalable and theme-consistent styles using :root variables. I also improved in debugging layout issues across screen sizes, which has made me more confident working with responsive design. Additionally, my use of semantic HTML and accessible link behaviors showed clear improvement.

🔮 Next Steps – What I plan to prioritize and do next
Review and refine the color scheme, fonts, and spacing using Bootstrap utilities and custom CSS for consistency.
Add transitions, animations, and subtle hover effects to improve interactivity.
Ensure the site is fully mobile responsive, checking layouts on various screen sizes.
Conduct a basic accessibility audit – including color contrast checks and ARIA labels where appropriate.
Polish shared elements like the navbar, footer, and other reusable components for a more professional finish.
