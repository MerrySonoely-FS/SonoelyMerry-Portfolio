# Week 1 - Research and Integrative Activity

## Research

- **GitHub Repositories & Portfolio Trends**:
  - Researched popular portfolio websites on GitHub.
  - Noted common trends such as clean layouts, project showcases, and use of animations.
  - Found inspiration in portfolios that integrated **React** and **GitHub Pages** for easy deployment.
  
- **React Setup**:
  - Reviewed official React documentation on [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
  - Investigated best practices for React component structure and directory organization.
  
- **CSS Styling & Responsiveness**:
  - Explored resources on responsive design techniques using CSS (via [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)) and mobile-first design.
  - Investigated CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**, but opted to use plain CSS for simplicity and control over design.

- **Version Control & Git**:
  - Reviewed Git branching strategies and learned how to create and manage feature branches.
  - Followed GitHub guides on collaborating via pull requests and issues for project management.

## Integrative Activity

- **Milestone Updates**:
  - Completed the first milestone: "Project Setup & Layout" by creating the repo, setting up the React app, and structuring the project.

- **GitHub Repo Setup**:
  - Created a new GitHub repository `my-portfolio`.
  - Initialized a React project using `create-react-app`.
  - Integrated **gh-pages** for deployment to GitHub Pages.
  - Set up initial GitHub issues and milestones for project management over 4 weeks.

- **Branching & Version Control**:
  - Created a `dev` branch for ongoing development work.
  - Committed and pushed initial code to the `dev` branch for further testing.

## Next Steps

- Begin styling the website and implementing React Router for multi-page navigation in Week 2.
- Refine layout and make it mobile-responsive.
- Continue adding components for the "About Me" and "Projects" sections.
