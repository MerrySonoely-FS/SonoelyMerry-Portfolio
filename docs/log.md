## Week 1
⚙️ **Overview - What I worked on this past week**:
This week, I made significant progress on the foundation of my personal portfolio website. Key accomplishments included:

Creating the GitHub repository and initializing the project using create-react-app.
Setting up React Router for navigation between multiple pages (Home, About Me, Projects).
Creating and adding some content in Home, About Me, and Projects pages.
Installing gh-pages for deployment to GitHub Pages, in Milestone 4.
Structuring the project with the initial components and layout, preparing the website for further styling and content population.
Conducted research on best practices for responsive design and CSS styling. 
Also researching how to implement an email-contact method in a future Contact page.

🌵 **Challenges- What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them**:
One of the main challenges I faced was an issue with React Router not working properly. The routing didn’t work as expected, which led to navigation issues. To resolve this, I took the following steps based on research:

Cleared npm cache with npm cache clean --force to ensure no cached data was causing the issue.
Deleted node_modules and the package-lock.json file to remove any conflicting or corrupted dependencies.
Reinstalled the dependencies with npm install.
Uninstalled and reinstalled React and React-DOM to make sure I was using the latest versions:
npm uninstall react react-dom
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
Finally, I rebuilt the project to clear any issues caused by old build data, running:
npm run build
After completing these steps, the routing issue was resolved, and the React Router worked as expected.

🏆 **Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week**:
I leveled up in debugging React and package management issues. Resolving the React Router issue helped me become more comfortable with handling dependency management, clearing cache, and rebuilding projects to ensure a clean slate. This has improved my troubleshooting skills and deepened my understanding of how React and package managers like npm work together.

🔮 **Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next**:
In the upcoming week, I plan to:

Advance styling the website, focusing on making it mobile-responsive and ensuring the layout looks great across all devices.
Implement React Router fully across all pages (Home, About Me, Projects) and refine the navigation system.
Start populating the About Me and Projects sections with more content and add interactivity (e.g., hover effects, smooth scrolling).
Begin focusing on design polish, ensuring the website is visually cohesive and aligned with my brand.
Review feedback from instructor and peers from Week 1 progress.

## Week 2

⚙️ Overview
This week, I focused on making my portfolio website both visually appealing and mobile-responsive. I used CSS Flexbox and Grid, and applied media queries to ensure the layout adapts across devices. I also started to look into adding a Contact Page with a functional form for user inquiries. This process highlighted the importance of designing with mobile-first principles while keeping flexibility for larger screens.
I’ve realized that the mobile-first approach is crucial for creating a better user experience. I struggled at times with ensuring consistency across devices—especially when switching from Flexbox to CSS Grid—but I’m getting better at managing these layout shifts.

🌵 Challenges
The main challenge this week was striking the right balance between simplicity and functionality when creating the mobile-responsive layouts. Initially, I found it difficult to get page to respond to different window sizes or a mobile device. Another issue was understanding how best to integrate a contact form with EmailJS. being my first time using it in a project. With some research, I was able to figure out how to best set up the contact page and create a reliable mobile responsiveness.
I think this week showed me the importance of simplifying things when needed. There were moments where I overcomplicated the layout adjustments, and in hindsight, I could have been more focused on simplicity and clarity in my design choices. It’s easy to get lost in the technical side, but remembering the user experience and design flow helps keep everything in perspective.

🏆 Accomplishments

I successfully created a mobile-first design that works well across small, medium, and large screens, incorporating CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure smooth layout adjustments.
Applied a cohesive color scheme and a few interactive elements like hover effects, which added polish and enhanced usability.
Completed research on Contact Page implementation, focusing on integrating a contact form.
Took a deeper dive into CSS Grid, and I’m feeling more confident about using it for complex layouts.
I feel proud of the progress I made this week. Creating a responsive layout was initially daunting, but seeing it all come together and function across devices was incredibly rewarding. The research into the Contact Page also gave me more insight into user interaction, and I’m excited to implement these features. However, I’ve learned that there’s always room for improvement when it comes to refining designs—whether it's about optimizing for mobile performance or ensuring smooth transitions between sections.

🔮 Next Steps

Integrate the Contact Page: I will move forward with implementing a contact form using EmailJS to ensure it's functional when connected to my EmailJS account.
Refine Responsive Layouts: I plan to fine-tune the CSS Grid layout when I add more content to the pages, especially for larger components like the portfolio section, and ensure the site maintains a clean design regardless of screen size.
Performance Improvements: I will focus on optimizing the website’s performance, especially for mobile users, by compressing images and cleaning up excess code to improve load times.
Content Development: Start drafting more content for the About Me and Projects pages, focusing on clear messaging and attractive design.
Self-Reflection: Moving forward, I want to stay mindful of not only how the website looks but how well it functions. I know that the details will make all the difference in delivering a seamless experience. Balancing between design and functionality will be crucial, especially as I start working on the content-heavy pages.

## Week 3

⚙️ **Overview - What I worked on this past week**:
This week, I focused on improving the foundation of my project by diving into UX/UI principles and Design Theory. I researched key design principles to better understand how to create user-centered, intuitive interfaces. Additionally, I worked on adding a Contact Page to my portfolio, which involved integrating a form and handling submissions through EmailJS.

I also took the time to assess feedback from Week 2, which allowed me to improve the structure and user flow of my portfolio. Lastly, I spent time on planning key elements using GitHub. I documented components, models, state, and routes using GitHub Issues, following a structured approach to outline what needs to be developed in future iterations of the app.

🌵 **Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them**:
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the Contact Page form worked seamlessly with EmailJS for email submissions. At first, the integration with EmailJS was tricky, and I encountered issues with the form data not being sent correctly. To address this, I carefully reviewed the API documentation, checked the keys I was using, and tested the integration thoroughly. I also ran some debugging in the browser console to ensure everything was linked properly.

Additionally, designing with UX/UI principles was a bit overwhelming at times, especially understanding the best practices for mobile-first design and accessibility. To overcome this, I broke down the theory into smaller chunks, starting with basic principles and applying them to my current work. I also consulted additional resources to clarify concepts I wasn’t familiar with.

🏆 **Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week**:
This week, I leveled up on planning and documentation. I successfully utilized GitHub Issues to outline key components, models, state, and routes for my project. This process helped me see the bigger picture for the app and provided a clear roadmap for future development. I also feel more confident with UX/UI design principles, which I applied while refining the layout and functionality of the Contact Page and assessing overall site design.

🔮 **Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next**:
