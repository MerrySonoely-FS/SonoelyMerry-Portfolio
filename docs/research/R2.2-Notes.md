# Week 2 Research Notes

## Topic: Unsplash API Integration for Dynamic Backgrounds

- **Date**: May 16, 2025
- **Overview**: This week, I explored the Unsplash API to add dynamic background images to my React portfolio. The goal was to create a more visually engaging landing experience by fetching high-quality photos based on predefined keywords. I also continued building toward the goals outlined in my 4-week portfolio enhancement roadmap.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Unsplash API Setup & Authentication**
- The [Unsplash Developers Platform](https://unsplash.com/developers) provides access to a vast library of free, high-resolution images.
- To get started:
  - Created an Unsplash developer account and registered an application.
  - Retrieved an **Access Key** and stored it securely in the `.env` file:
    ```env
    VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
    ```
  - Used `fetch()` to request a random image:
    ```javascript
    fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?query=technology&client_id=${import.meta.env.VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setImageUrl(data.urls.regular))
      .catch(error => console.error('Image fetch failed:', error));
    ```

### 2. **React Integration with useEffect**
- Used `useEffect()` to fetch the background image on component mount.
- Stored the image URL using `useState()` and applied it with inline styles:
  ```jsx
  style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${imageUrl})` }}
