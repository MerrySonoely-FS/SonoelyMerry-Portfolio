# Week 1 Research Notes

## Topic: EmailJS Integration and Portfolio Enhancement Plan

- **Date**: May 10, 2025
- **Overview**: This week, I researched how to securely integrate EmailJS into a React application to enable form-based email submissions. I also finalized my 4-week development roadmap to enhance the interactivity, design, and overall functionality of my portfolio website.

## Key Insights

### 1. **EmailJS Setup & Integration**
   - EmailJS allows sending emails directly from client-side JavaScript without exposing private email credentials.
   - Key steps for integration:
     - Create a free [EmailJS account](https://www.emailjs.com/).
     - Set up an **Email Service**, **Template**, and **Public Key** in the EmailJS dashboard.
     - Install the package via npm:  
       ```bash
       npm install @emailjs/browser
       ```
     - Secure keys using `.env` variables and access them with `process.env.REACT_APP_*` prefixes in React.
   - `emailjs.sendForm()` is used to send the form data asynchronously.
   - Itâ€™s important to implement client-side validation and use loading states for better UX.

### 2. **React Contact Form Improvements**
   - Refactored the form to:
     - Validate input before submission.
     - Show loading indicators while sending.
     - Display success/error messages based on API response.
   - Learned how to conditionally render feedback messages using `useState()` and custom CSS classes.

### 3. **Security & Best Practices**
   - Store EmailJS service/template/public keys in `.env` files to prevent accidental exposure.
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid pushing secrets to GitHub.
   - Restart the React server after changing environment variables to make them accessible in the app.
