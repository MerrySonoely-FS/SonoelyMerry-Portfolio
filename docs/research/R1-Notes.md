## Key Insights

### 1. **GitHub Repositories & Portfolio Trends**
   - Portfolios typically feature **clean layouts**, **clear navigation**, and **modern design principles**.
   - Interactive elements, such as hover effects and animations, are common to enhance user engagement.
   - Many portfolios use **React** for dynamic content and **GitHub Pages** for quick and free deployment.

### 2. **React Setup**
   - I reviewed the **create-react-app** documentation for setting up React apps.
   - React's **component-based architecture** promotes modular and reusable components.
   - Best practices for React app structure:
     - Keep components small and focused.
     - Organize components into folders by functionality (e.g., `components`, `containers`).
     - Maintain a lean `App.js` by moving logic to separate modules.

### 3. **CSS Styling & Responsiveness**
   - Explored **responsive design** and **mobile-first design principles** from MDN Web Docs.
   - After evaluating **CSS frameworks** like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**, I decided to use **plain CSS** for more control over the design.
   - Best practices:
     - Use relative units (`em`, `%`, `rem`) instead of fixed units (`px`).
     - Start with mobile-first design and scale up for larger screens using media queries.

### 4. **Version Control & Git**
   - Reviewed **Git branching strategies** such as **Git Flow** and **Feature Branch Workflow**.
   - Learned how to manage feature branches and create pull requests for collaboration and project management on GitHub.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. **Page Structure**:
   - Created the **Home**, **About Me**, and **Projects** pages for my portfolio.
   - Used **React Router** for seamless navigation between these pages, ensuring users can easily move through the sections.

### 2. **Header & Navigation**:
   - Implemented a **Header** component with navigation links to the different pages.
   - Integrated **React Router** to make the navigation dynamic, improving the user experience.

### 3. **Layout and Styling**:
   - Applied **CSS Flexbox** to create responsive layouts for the pages.
   - Styled the pages with simple CSS, focusing on spacing, alignment, and image positioning.
   - Incorporated **photos** on the pages to make the portfolio visually appealing.
