# Week 3 Research Notes

## Topic: Expanding the Projects Page with Interactive GitHub Project Showcases

- **Date**: May 23, 2025
- **Overview**:  
  This week, I focused on enhancing the Projects section of my portfolio to better represent my work and technical experience. The objective was to feature more GitHub projects with an interactive and informative UI. I experimented with new card layouts, hover effects, and tooltips, while also exploring the option of dynamically pulling data from the GitHub API.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Project Card Expansion**
- Added new React components to represent individual projects using the existing design system.
- Structured project data with fields for:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tech stack
  - GitHub link
  - Demo link (if available)
- Example project object:
  ```javascript
  const projects = [
    {
      title: 'Weather App',
      description: 'A real-time weather forecast app using OpenWeatherMap API.'
      github: 'https://github.com/username/weather-app',
    },
    // ...
  ];
