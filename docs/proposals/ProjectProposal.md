# Project Proposal: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Project Overview

### **Project Name**: Personal Portfolio Website

## Application Definition Statement

*A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

The goal of this project is to build a **personal portfolio website** to showcase my skills as a web developer. This portfolio will highlight my past projects, provide details about my background.

### **Objective**:
This portfolio will serve as a professional online presence where I can display my technical skills and experience. It will include a **Home Page**, an **About Me** section, and a **Projects** page. The website will be built using **React.js**, styled with **CSS**, and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

## Target Market

*Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles.

[A front-end developer's personal portfolio targets employers, clients, industry peers, and the tech community. It showcases technical skills, project examples, and design expertise, helping attract job opportunities, freelance work, and collaboration. The site serves as a professional hub for networking, career growth, and engagement with the broader tech ecosystem.]

## User Profile / Persona

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*


[ Jake Fitzgerald, a 28-year-old self-taught front-end developer based in San Francisco, has 5+ years of experience creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and web apps. As a freelancer, Jake seeks to showcase their technical skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and UI/UX design, while attracting clients and job opportunities. Their portfolio needs to demonstrate both creativity and clean code, with live project demos, case studies, and blog posts on front-end development. Jake values efficiency, continuous learning, and collaboration, aiming to stay current with industry trends and connect with potential employers or collaborators. ]

## Use Cases

*A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used.*

*Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing.*

[ Use Case 1: Job Seeker – User uses their portfolio to showcase projects and skills, attracting potential employers who contact them for job opportunities after discovering the site through SEO.

Use Case 2: Client Engagement – A client finds the User’s portfolio, reviews relevant projects, and contacts them via the site’s form for a freelance project, leading to a proposal and collaboration.

Use Case 3: Networking & Community Engagement – User shares blog posts or open-source contributions on their site, engaging with other developers and building their professional network. ]

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

[ Many front-end developers struggle to effectively showcase their skills and projects in a competitive job market. Without a professional portfolio, they miss opportunities to attract employers, clients, and collaborators. There is a need for a personal portfolio website that highlights a developer's work, coding expertise, and design skills, while offering a user-friendly and engaging platform for career growth and networking. ]


## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

[ Front-end developers struggle to stand out without a professional portfolio, as resumes fail to showcase their coding skills and design work. Limited time and difficulty keeping content updated further hinder their ability to maintain a polished online presence, making it harder to attract job opportunities or clients in a competitive market. ]

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

[ The solution is a user-friendly portfolio website that lets front-end developers showcase their skills, projects, and design work in a visually appealing, easily updatable format. It provides live demos, code samples, and an interactive resume, helping developers stand out to employers and clients while simplifying portfolio maintenance and updates. ]

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

[ Direct competition includes website builders like Wix and Webflow, which lack the flexibility for showcasing coding skills, while GitHub Pages and Netlify require technical expertise. Indirect competition comes from LinkedIn, Dribbble, and Behance, which are great for design but don't highlight coding or interactive projects. There’s a need for a platform that combines ease of use with the ability to showcase both technical and design skills effectively. ]

## Features & Functionality

*Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points.*

*A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'.*

*Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows.*

[ The key features of the front-end developer portfolio website includes a project gallery to showcase work with links to live demos and code, an interactive resume to highlight experience and skills, and a contact form for easy communication with potential employers or clients. The site is mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. These features make it easy for developers to present their work and connect with opportunities in a clean, efficient format. ]


## Integrations

*Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

[The portfolio will use EmailJS to handle contact form submissions, sending messages directly to the developer’s email without a backend. This integration streamlines communication, provides real-time notifications, and allows for customizable email templates, making it easy to manage and respond to opportunities efficiently.]
