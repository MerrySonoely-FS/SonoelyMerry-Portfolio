⚙️ Overview – Week 3 - 05-23-25
This past week, I continued enhancing my portfolio site, focusing on expanding content and introducing interactivity. I added detailed project descriptions to the Projects page, implemented modal windows to showcase project details without navigating away, and introduced subtle animations to make the site more dynamic. These updates help make the experience more engaging and informative for users.

🌵 Challenges – What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
One challenge this week was managing the complexity of modal interactions across different devices. Initially, some modals weren't behaving consistently on smaller screens. I resolved this by adjusting z-index layers, ensuring appropriate overflow handling, and testing across multiple breakpoints. I also found it tricky to balance animation speed with usability, but using ease-in-out timing and limiting animation durations helped maintain smooth interactions without slowing the user experience.

🏆 Accomplishments – What is something I "leveled up" on this week
This week, I leveled up in implementing dynamic front-end features. I gained hands-on experience working with JavaScript-driven UI components like modals and learned how to create smooth, non-intrusive animations using CSS keyframes and transition timing functions. These improvements not only enhanced the user experience but also deepened my understanding of interactive design principles.
