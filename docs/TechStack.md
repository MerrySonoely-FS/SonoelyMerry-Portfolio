# Tech Stack

A tech stack with React, Express, CSS, and Javascript enhances my ability to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive web applications. React allows one to create a modular, scalable UIs with efficient state management. Express provides a flexible, robust framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic. CSS enables one to craft visually appealing, responsive designs with modern layout techniques like FLexbox and Grid. JavaScript powers the interactivity and asynchronous functionality of projects, demonstrating a grasp of core web development principals. Together, these technlogie highlight my proficiency in creating user-centric, high-performance websites, making me a strong candidate for moden web development roles.

## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

[I plan on using Material UI (MUI), this is one of the most popular React UI libraries, which provides a comprehensive set of components based on Google's Material Design. It's highly customizable and supports features like dark mode, themeing, and responsive design.]

## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

2. Setting Up Development Environment
3. Design Implementation (UI/UX)
4. Componentization & Structure]

## State Managemen

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

[I'll be using EmailJS in my Contact page for email messaging. If a visitor would like to reach out to me this is how they can without making my email public.]

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

[I'll be using node in the form of NPM. I find this way to be simple especially in using Reactjs.]

## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

[In a full-stack app with Express and React, Express handles server-side routes for API requests, while React Router manages client-side routes for page navigation. React communicates with Express via asynchronous calls to fetch or send data, ensuring seamless navigation and dynamic content updates without page reloads.]
