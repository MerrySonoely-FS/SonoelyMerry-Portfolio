# Tech Stack

A tech stack with React, Express, CSS, and JavaScript enhances my ability to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive web applications. React allows one to create modular, scalable UIs with efficient state management. Express provides a flexible, robust framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic. CSS enables one to craft visually appealing, responsive designs with modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid. JavaScript powers the interactivity and asynchronous functionality of projects, demonstrating a grasp of core web development principles. Together, these technologies highlight my proficiency in creating user-centric, high-performance websites, making me a strong candidate for modern web development roles.

## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

I plan on using Material UI (MUI), one of the most popular React UI libraries, which provides a comprehensive set of components based on Google's Material Design. It's highly customizable and supports features like dark mode, theming, and responsive design.

## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

1. Understanding Requirements and Planning  
2. Setting Up Development Environment  
3. Design Implementation (UI/UX)  
4. Componentization & Structure  

## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

I'll be using EmailJS in my Contact page for email messaging. If a visitor would like to reach out to me, this is how they can without making my email public.

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

I'll be using Node in the form of NPM. I find this way to be simple, especially in using React.js.

## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by Express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

In a full-stack app with Express and React, Express handles server-side routes for API requests, while React Router manages client-side routes for page navigation. React communicates with Express via asynchronous calls to fetch or send data, ensuring seamless navigation and dynamic content updates without page reloads.

## 📌 Change Order

### 1. Proposal & Tech Stack Documents
The current Proposal and Tech Stack documents accurately summarize the original scope of the portfolio project, including the use of React, Express, CSS, JavaScript, and integrations such as EmailJS.

### 2. Work Remaining (Estimated)
- Integration of EmailJS (in progress)
- Unsplash API for dynamic background image (planned)
- Expansion of GitHub Projects section with hover UI (planned)
- Global styling and responsive UX polish (final phase)
- Testing and cleanup (ongoing throughout)
> Roughly **40–50%** of the work remains, to be completed over the next **3 weeks**.

### 3. Proposed Changes to Scope
- 🔄 **EmailJS Integration:** Already underway; originally not detailed in depth.
- 🖼️ **Unsplash API**: New feature to dynamically pull background imagery.
- 💡 **Expanded Projects Page:** Adding more GitHub cards with hover details to improve portfolio depth and interactivity.
- 🎨 **Style Enhancements:** Refined styling beyond the original outline, improving mobile responsiveness and visual consistency.

If approved, these changes will improve the interactivity, design quality, and technical showcase of the portfolio, aligning it more closely with real-world front-end standards.
