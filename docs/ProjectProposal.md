# Project Proposal: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Project Overview

### **Project Name**: Personal Portfolio Website

The goal of this project is to build a **personal portfolio website** to showcase my skills as a web developer. This portfolio will highlight my past projects, provide details about my background.

### **Objective**:
This portfolio will serve as a professional online presence where I can display my technical skills and experience. It will include a **Home Page**, an **About Me** section, and a **Projects** page. The website will be built using **React.js**, styled with **CSS**, and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

## 3. Design Concept

### **Color Scheme**:
- **Primary Colors**: Blue (#3498db), Green (#2ecc71), White (#ffffff) for a fresh and professional look.
- **Secondary Colors**: Light grey for background elements (#ecf0f1) and dark grey for text (#2c3e50).

### **Typography**:
- **Primary Font**: 'Roboto' for body text (modern and clean).
- **Secondary Font**: 'Open Sans' for headings (to make it visually distinctive).

### **Layout**:
- **Home Page**: A brief introduction with a photo or avatar, a short bio, and a call-to-action button to encourage visitors to explore the site.
- **About Me**: A section dedicated to detailing my background, skills, and experience as a developer.
- **Projects**: A gallery or grid displaying key projects I've worked on. Each project will have a title, a short description, and a link to the project or its code repository.

### **Responsiveness**:
- The website will be fully responsive, meaning it will adapt to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. I will use **CSS media queries** and **Flexbox/Grid** for a flexible, adaptable layout.
