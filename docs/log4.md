⚙️ Overview – Week 4 - 05-30-25
This week, I focused on finalizing my portfolio website and preparing it for deployment. I completed all remaining content, refined layout consistency, and polished the overall user interface. Once everything was in place, I deployed the site to GitHub Pages and conducted thorough tests to ensure responsiveness and usability across different devices and browsers.

🌵 Challenges – What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
A key challenge was ensuring the site functioned correctly once hosted on GitHub Pages. I encountered issues with relative paths for assets and links, which required updating base paths and restructuring some folders. I also had to address slight inconsistencies in how animations and layout behaved on different screen sizes, which I resolved through additional media queries and testing with browser dev tools.

🏆 Accomplishments – What is something I "leveled up" on this week
This week, I leveled up in the deployment process and final presentation of a project. I successfully launched my site on GitHub Pages and gained hands-on experience with preparing a production-ready codebase. I also refined my skills in debugging UI inconsistencies and ensuring a cohesive experience across platforms—key steps in delivering a polished, professional product.

🔮 Next Steps

Deploy the finalized site to GitHub Pages (in progress or pending final checks).
Create a project showcase page or section to present key features, technologies used, and the development process.
Begin sharing the portfolio with peers, mentors, and potential collaborators for feedback.
