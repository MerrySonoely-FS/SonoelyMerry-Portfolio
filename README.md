🌐 Front-End Portfolio - Sonoely Merry

Welcome to my front-end development portfolio! This web application is a showcase of my skills in building modern, responsive, and interactive user interfaces using React, CSS, and third-party APIs such as EmailJS and Unsplash.

🚀 About the Project

This portfolio site is designed to demonstrate my capabilities as a front-end developer. It includes a project gallery, dynamic background visuals via the Unsplash API, and a contact form powered by EmailJS — all styled with clean, responsive CSS.

🛠 Technologies Used

React – Component-based UI
CSS3 – Custom responsive styling
EmailJS – Client-side form submission without a backend
Unsplash API – Dynamic image integration
JavaScript (ES6+)
Node.js (for development tooling)

✉️ EmailJS Integration

The contact form uses EmailJS to send messages directly from the frontend without requiring a backend server.

🔧 To configure:
Sign up at emailjs.com
Add your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key to a secure location such as an .env file
Import and use emailjs.sendForm(...) in your form handler
🖼️ Unsplash API

Images throughout the site are fetched dynamically using the Unsplash API.

🔧 To use:
Create a developer account at Unsplash Developers
Add your Access Key to your environment or configuration file
API calls are managed within the api/ directory
